# Dinify Frontend — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview
Dinify is a QR-code-based digital ordering and restaurant management platform
built for Uganda and mobile-money-first markets. This repo contains three
portals — Restaurant Management Portal, Diner App, and Platform Admin —
plus a staff-facing Kitchen View board (route `/kitchen`).
Deployed to Firebase Hosting at dinify-prod.web.app.
A parallel `AGENTS.md` at the repo root carries Codex/other-agent instructions
that defer to this file — `CLAUDE.md` remains the authoritative project guide,
so keep it current when conventions change.

## Tech Stack
- Angular 20 with mixed component pattern (see below)
- Builds/serves/tests run on the esbuild-based `@angular/build` application
  builder (`@angular/build:application`, `:dev-server`, `:karma`) — migrated
  off the legacy webpack `@angular-devkit/build-angular` builder
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Hosting (auto-deploys on push to main via GitHub Actions)
- Repo: mugak1/Dinify-Frontend

## Current Implementation Status
- Phase 0 (Foundation): ✅ Complete
- Phase 1 (Menu module, all sub-phases 1a–1d): ✅ Complete
- Phase 2 (Dashboard): ✅ Complete — `USE_MOCK_DATA` still true in DashboardService
  for the core metrics, but TWO cards are real-wired exceptions: the Popular Items
  card overlays real menu-item identities onto the (still-mock) metrics, and the
  Reviews card pulls live data via `reviews/summary/` behind its own
  `USE_MOCK_REVIEWS = false` flag
- Diner App menu redesign: ✅ Complete (sticky brand strip, scroll-aware nav
  pills, quick-add affordance, allergen-safety disclaimer banner)
- Diner discount/price UI: ✅ Complete — every diner price surface (item-detail,
  menu card, featured carousel, basket) now renders through the shared
  presentational trio (`app-price-display` / `app-discount-badge` /
  `app-savings-indicator`, see Shared UI Component Library) fed from the canonical
  server-truth `discount_details`, replacing the per-surface hand-rolled
  strikethrough / badge markup
- Dashboard responsiveness: ✅ Complete
- Phase 3 (Tables module): 🔄 MVP ships Setup View only (route `dining-tables`)
  - Setup View (areas, tables): ✅ wired to real API (`USE_MOCK_SETUP = false`);
    blocked deletes (e.g. an area that still has tables) surface the backend
    message as a single toast (see error-handling note below)
  - Service View (reservations, waitlist, seated parties): ⏸️ parked AND hidden
    from the UI — its component/services/mocks/models stay in the repo but are
    NOT rendered. `TablesComponent.activeView` is forced to `'setup'` (seed +
    validate honour only `'setup'`), so re-enabling the toggle later is a small
    revert. Service code still sits behind `USE_MOCK_SERVICE = true`
- Menu polish pass: ✅ Complete — canonical `discount_details` shape, native
  `preset_tags` arrays, paginated menusections/menuitems, allergens rewired
  onto the `tags` field as the dietary-tag source of truth
- Menu modifiers & extras: ✅ Complete — menu items carry modifier groups
  (`MenuItem.options: ItemModifiers` = `{hasModifiers, groups: ModifierGroup[]}`)
  and linked add-on extras (`has_extras` + `extras: MenuItemExtraRef[]`).
  Operators edit them in the item form via two standalone tabs
  (`ItemModifiersTabComponent`, `ItemExtrasTabComponent` inside the standalone
  `ItemFormDialogComponent`); diners customise an item on the diner-app
  `menu-item-detail` screen before it hits the basket, and the restaurant-portal
  preview drawer (`PreviewMenuDrawerComponent`) mirrors the live diner UI. Both
  the diner browse card and the preview drawer now render through one shared
  `MenuDishCardComponent` (the single source of truth for the dish card).
  Real-wired through the existing menu endpoints (`restaurant-setup/menuitems/`);
  no dedicated mock flag (see Key Domain Concepts for the payload shape)
- Kitchen View (KDS board): ✅ Complete — Phase 1 (mock board UI) and Phase 3
  (live order data) both done. Separate top-level lazy module at
  `src/app/kitchen/` (route `/kitchen`, AuthGuard-protected).
  `KitchenOrderService.USE_MOCK_DATA = false`; HTTP polling + optimistic PATCH
  against real endpoints. Kitchen-only staff land here automatically on login:
  `LoginComponent.landingPathForMembership` routes a membership whose roles
  include `'kitchen'` but neither `'owner'` nor `'manager'` to `/kitchen`, and
  everyone else to their first accessible module (Dashboard first). The post-login
  redirect ALWAYS lands on this computed module — it no longer honors a `returnUrl`
  deep link, and neither the `AuthGuard` nor the inactivity logout captures one, so
  re-authenticating (manual sign-out OR the 15-min idle timeout) never resumes the
  last-visited module. The restaurant portal sidebar now ALSO surfaces a
  **Kitchen** entry (route `/kitchen`, gated on the `kitchen` module —
  owner/manager/kitchen see it, `restaurant_staff` does not), so back-office
  staff reach the board from portal nav, not only via the login auto-redirect
- Support: ✅ real-wired — the restaurant Support page (`support/`) reads/writes
  the `support/issues/` API; the Dinify-admin triage screen
  (`dinify-mgt/mgt-support`) is wired against `support/admin/issues/`.
  Status/category/impact badge styling + labels are shared from
  `src/app/_shared/support/`
- Settings: ✅ rebuilt as a grouped hub shell (route `settings`,
  `SettingsHubComponent`) with standalone, real-wired section pages —
  Restaurant identity & branding (`settings/restaurant`, `IdentityComponent`),
  Availability (`settings/availability`, `AvailabilityComponent` —
  `accepting_orders` toggle), Team / Members (`settings/team/members`,
  `RestUsersComponent` rehomed under a `TeamShellComponent` master–detail hub at
  route `settings/team` — sub-nav gated on `nav.length > 1`, now revealed by the
  owner-only **Roles & access** grid (`settings/team/roles`, `RolesAccessComponent`)
  appended alongside Members (it inherits the team-parent RBAC guard, so it is
  owner-only by composition — no child guard); a role×module grid that reads/PUTs
  `RolePermissionsService` (the owner row is locked from the response's `editable`
  flag, never the role name); the role picker is aligned to the four backend roles
  (Owner/Manager/Chef/Staff; Staff emits `restaurant_staff`, finance + waiter
  retired) and a brand-new employee's one-time temp password is surfaced on a
  persistent, non-dismissable `StaffCredentialDialogComponent`), Tax & receipts
  (`settings/tax-receipts`, `TaxReceiptsComponent`), Billing (`settings/billing`,
  subscription-only — `BillingComponent` is the one section still in
  `declarations`, i.e. non-standalone), Account & security (`settings/account`,
  `AccountSecurityComponent`), and Preset tags (`settings/preset-tags`,
  `PresetTagsComponent`). Shared section chrome lives in `settings/components/`
  (`SectionPageComponent`, `SettingsIconComponent`); the old monolithic
  `SettingsComponent` is gone. The form-owning section pages (Restaurant identity,
  Availability, Tax & receipts, Account & security) implement `HasUnsavedChanges`
  and are protected by the shared route-level `unsavedChangesGuard`
  (`_helpers/unsaved-changes.guard.ts`, a `CanDeactivate` guard that prompts before
  navigating away with unsaved edits)
- My account page: ✅ a standalone, read-only personal profile page (route
  `account` → `AccountComponent`, title "My account") showing the signed-in
  user's Name / Email / Phone / Role / Restaurant plus a Sign-out button. It is
  DISTINCT from `settings/account` (`AccountSecurityComponent`, the
  security/password section). It is NOT module-guarded (any signed-in member
  reaches it), is opened from the account chip pinned to the bottom of the
  `SidebarComponent`, and is the `/rest-app/account` landing fallback for a
  member with no accessible modules (the "No modules assigned" case). The
  shared `app-dn-avatar` (initials-in-a-circle) renders the user glyph here and
  in the sidebar chip
- Reviews: ✅ real-wired — a standalone Overview (route `reviews`,
  `ReviewsOverviewComponent`: summary line, needs-attention block, dimension
  breakdown, rating-trend chart) plus a Feed (route `reviews/feed`,
  `ReviewsFeedComponent`: list with critical/resolution/rating filters, a
  needs-attention queue, resolve/reopen with an optional resolution note, and
  deep-linking to a flagged review). Both read/write the `reviews/` API through a
  dedicated `ReviewsService` (no mock flag) with a `reviews-adapter` parsing
  layer; diners leave a review on the diner-app order-complete screen (POST
  `reviews/submit/`, gated on a real backend order id), optionally attaching
  one-tap quick-feedback chips (canonical key→label set in `_shared/reviews/`)
  that surface read-only on the operator Feed. The old monolithic
  reviews-management surface has been removed
- Reports: ✅ a master–detail shell (route `reports`, `ReportsShellComponent`)
  with a persistent, per-restaurant-persisted date-range bar sitting above the
  `<router-outlet>` and four standalone child reports — Sales (`reports/sales`,
  the default), Menu performance (`reports/menu`), Transactions
  (`reports/transactions`), and Diners (`reports/diners`). Each report carries a
  shared CSV / XLSX / Print export bar (XLSX via the dynamically-imported
  `write-excel-file` dep; Print via a generated print sheet). Still mock-first:
  `ReportsService.USE_MOCK_DATA = true`, mirroring DashboardService, with a
  dormant `reports-adapter` parsing layer (mirrors `reviews-adapter`) over
  scaffolded real endpoints. The old monolithic `report-detail` surface is gone.
  Reports is NOT chart-free: the Sales report renders a revenue-trend LINE chart
  (`revenue-trend-card`) and a KPI rail of inline sparklines (`stat-sparkline` /
  `ReportSparklineComponent`, via `sales-kpi-rail`) on the SAME shared house
  ng2-charts / chart.js stack Dashboard uses (`provideCharts(withDefaultRegisterables())`
  registered in `RestaurantMgtModule`). The other report visualisations — Sales'
  orders-by-hour & revenue-weekday, Menu top-items, Transactions status-breakdown,
  Diners composition — are hand-rolled CSS `[style.width.%]` / `[style.height.%]`
  bars, NOT ng2-charts
- Payments: removed — the standalone restaurant Payments module (its real
  transactions listing plus the dead Falcon wallet UI: Disburse Funds,
  DinifyAccount balance) has been deleted. There is no `payments` route or
  sidebar entry; the `reports/restaurant/transactions-listing/` data now backs
  the Reports module's Transactions report instead
- Notifications: scaffolded and routed (route `notifications`,
  `RestNotificationsComponent`) — per-view data-wiring status varies
- Offline/connectivity UX: ✅ a `ConnectivityService` (`navigator.onLine`) drives a
  persistent `OfflineBannerComponent` in the back-office shells (restaurant +
  Dinify admin) and an `OfflineStripComponent` in the diner app. The HTTP error
  interceptor surfaces request failures as toasts via `ToastService` (the legacy
  `MessageService` banner is retired) and suppresses its global 'no network' toast
  where a banner already shows (see error-handling note below)
- Legal pages: standalone components in `src/app/legal/` (privacy-policy,
  terms-and-conditions, cookie-policy), lazy-loaded as public routes
  `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies` via `loadComponent` in `app-routing.module.ts`
- The legacy Falcon Orders page has been removed — there is no Orders route,
  component, or sidebar entry in the restaurant portal. Live order/fulfilment
  flow lives in the Kitchen View (KDS board) at `/kitchen`. The diner app's
  parked OrdersComponent (another dead Falcon payment screen) has likewise been
  removed

## Deployment Rules — CRITICAL
- Pushing to main triggers automatic Firebase deployment via GitHub Actions
- NEVER suggest manual deployment steps — the pipeline handles everything
- Each feature must be on its own branch → PR → merge
- Never stack work on unmerged branches

## Branch Selection — CRITICAL
- When the task text (the prompt provided for the task) names a specific
  branch, ALWAYS develop on and push to THAT branch — the branch named in the
  task text is authoritative and takes precedence over the session-designated
  branch
- Do NOT default to the session-designated branch (the auto-generated
  `claude/...` branch injected into the session/environment setup) when the
  task text names a different branch
- The session-designated branch is only the fallback for when the task text
  does not name a branch at all

## Branch Base — CRITICAL (never branch off a stale `main`)
- Before creating a feature branch, ALWAYS `git fetch origin main` first, then cut
  the branch from `origin/main` (e.g. `git checkout -b <new-branch> origin/main`).
  NEVER branch from the local `main` ref: in a freshly-cloned web container it can
  be stale (behind the real remote), silently basing your work on outdated code —
  this is how PR #395 was first cut from a 59-commit-old `main`.
- A `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, registered in
  `.claude/settings.json`) auto-runs `git fetch origin main` (and installs node deps)
  each web session — but still branch explicitly from the fetched `origin/main`, not
  local `main`.
- If you discover mid-task that the base was stale, `git rebase origin/main` and
  re-run verification before pushing.

## Visual Reference
- The Lovable React prototype (mugak1/Dinify-Restaurant-Portal) is the
  canonical visual reference for ALL UI work
- Always check the prototype for layout, spacing, component behaviour,
  and visual design before writing any code

## Component Pattern — CRITICAL
The module uses a deliberate mixed pattern — follow it exactly:
- Older components (DashboardComponent, MenuComponent, SupportComponent,
  BillingComponent, RestNotificationsComponent) are NON-standalone — they go in
  `declarations` (that is the current full `RestaurantMgtModule.declarations`
  set; the old ReportsComponent/ReviewsComponent have been replaced by
  standalone components)
- Newer components (SidebarComponent, TopNavComponent, TablesComponent,
  all shared UI components) are STANDALONE — they go in `imports`
- When creating a new component, make it standalone and add it to `imports`
- Never put a standalone component in `declarations`. The AOT production
  build (`npm run build:prod`) already guards this: it fails with error
  **NG6008** ("Component … is standalone, and cannot be declared in an
  NgModule. Did you mean to import it instead?"), and CI runs `build:prod`
  on every PR. Note `npm run type-check` does NOT catch it (plain `tsc`
  doesn't run the Angular compiler), so the prod build is the real gate.
  (Verified 2026-06; supersedes the earlier "silently renders an empty
  element" note, which does not hold for the AOT prod build — so no
  separate lint/CI guard is needed.)
- A lazy feature module may host a STANDALONE root component resolved
  directly by the router with an empty (or absent) `declarations` array —
  see `KitchenModule`/`BoardComponent` (mirrors the diner-app pattern)

## Shared UI Component Library
A shared component library lives in `src/app/_shared/ui/`:
allergen-disclaimer, avatar (`app-dn-avatar`, initials-in-a-circle), badge,
button (`app-dn-button`), card, dialog, discount-badge, extras-selector,
featured-carousel, menu-dish-card, modifier-groups-selector, offline-banner,
page-header (`app-page-header`), price-display, savings-indicator,
segmented (`app-dn-segmented`), sheet, switch (`app-dn-switch`; supports a
`disabled` input for locked toggles, e.g. the Roles & access owner row), toast —
plus the `tooltip` directive (`[appTooltip]`, not a component), the
`SafeArrayPipe`, and the `HighlightPipe` (search-term highlighting). The
`toast/` folder also exports the injectable `ToastService` (the app-wide toast
queue), re-exported from the barrel.

`app-dn-segmented` is the single shared segmented / tab control — it REPLACED
the deleted `dn-tabs` component (do not reintroduce a `tabs` component). It runs
in two modes: `mode="value"` (the default — emits the picked value; used for
in-page toggles like the dashboard card sort switches and the item-form tabs)
and `mode="router"` (each segment is a `routerLink`, for route-driven rails like
the Reports shell). `app-page-header` is the shared portal page-title block (its
Gabarito heading comes from the `app-restaurant-mgt h1` selector, plus an
optional subtitle and a right-aligned actions slot) — reuse it for portal page
titles instead of hand-rolling an `<h1>`. All portal buttons/CTAs are unified on
`app-dn-button` (selector `app-dn-button, button[app-dn-button]`).

The diner price surfaces share a presentational trio (all in `_shared/ui/`,
re-exported from the barrel): `app-price-display` (bold brand-red effective price
beside a struck grey original; sizes sm→lg, optional `+` prefix for add-ons),
`app-discount-badge` ("X% off" green pill — `frosted` hero / `solid` overlay
variants, optional `· Save UGX Y` suffix), and `app-savings-indicator`
("Save UGX X" pill / "Total savings" banner). All three are pure (numbers in,
formatted via the shared `formatUGX`; no item objects, discount-gate or fetch
logic) and back item-detail, the menu card, the featured carousel and the basket
from the canonical server-truth `discount_details`. Reuse them before
hand-rolling any price / discount / savings markup.

The menu / item-customisation surfaces share three more presentational
components (all in `_shared/ui/`, re-exported from the barrel):
`app-menu-dish-card` (the single source of truth for BOTH the diner browse card
and the restaurant-portal preview drawer — takes pre-resolved
name/price/discount/tags and emits one `(cardClick)`), `app-modifier-groups-selector`
(the single/multi modifier-choice UI) and `app-extras-selector` (the "Add Extras"
checkbox list). Like the price trio they are pure — the host owns all selection
state, validation and inline-error text and feeds `selected`/`errors` in. Reuse
them on both the diner item-detail and the preview drawer so the two surfaces
never drift.

Re-exports live in `src/app/_shared/ui/index.ts` — but the barrel does NOT
re-export `FeaturedCarouselComponent`, the tooltip directive, or
`HighlightPipe`; import those from their own file paths. Always use these
existing components before creating new ones. They are all standalone and
go in the module `imports` array.

Four more reuse-first libraries sit alongside `ui/` — check them before
writing new tag or price/menu logic:
- `src/app/_shared/tags/` (barrel `index.ts`) — the dietary-tag system:
  `TagColour`/`TagIcon`/`TagCategory`, `TAG_COLOUR_PALETTE`, `TAG_ICONS`,
  `TAG_CATEGORIES`, `TagPillComponent`, `TagOverflowPillComponent`,
  `MenuItemTagSelectorComponent`, plus `filterMenuItems` and truncation helpers
- `src/app/_shared/utils/` (per-file imports, no barrel) — `cn`, `formatUGX`,
  price/discount helpers (`getCurrentPrice`, `isDiscountActive`,
  `calculateSavings`, `getDiscountBadgeText`), and `searchMenuItems` /
  `applyMenuSort`
- `src/app/_shared/support/` (barrel `index.ts`) — support-issue display
  metadata: `STATUS_META`/`CATEGORY_LABEL`/`IMPACT_LABEL` maps, the matching
  `statusMeta`/`categoryLabel`/`impactLabel` helpers, and
  `CATEGORY_OPTIONS`/`IMPACT_OPTIONS`. Shared by the restaurant Support page and
  the Dinify-admin triage screen — reuse before hand-rolling status badges or
  category labels
- `src/app/_shared/reviews/` (per-file imports, no barrel) — the diner
  quick-feedback chip taxonomy: `ReviewTagChip`, the canonical `REVIEW_TAG_CHIPS`
  set, and the `reviewTagLabel` key→label helper (unknown keys are humanized so
  a never-before-seen key still renders a clean badge). Chips are persisted as
  stable keys; the diner order-complete screen renders the tappable chip set and
  the operator Reviews feed renders the stored keys back as read-only labels.
  Distinct from the dietary-tag system in `_shared/tags/` — do not conflate the
  two taxonomies

## Angular Rules
- Always set `outputHashing: "all"` across ALL build configurations
- Never use lucide-angular in new code — use inline SVGs instead. (The
  legacy Platform Admin module `dinify-mgt` still imports it; do not
  extend that usage.)

## Styling Rules
- `overflow-hidden` on layout containers is intentional — matches the
  Lovable prototype. Do not remove it to fix visual clipping issues
- Collapse toggle elements must be inside a `relative` wrapper div
- Typography — three variable fonts are imported in `src/styles.css`, each
  with a distinct role. Plus Jakarta Sans is the default body (`font-sans`);
  the `font-display` Tailwind utility maps to Bricolage Grotesque (used by the
  diner app, Kitchen board, login, and the shared featured-carousel). The
  restaurant portal layers a Gabarito display tier on top via a raw CSS rule —
  `app-restaurant-mgt h1/h2/h3` and `app-animated-number` (dashboard metric
  numbers) render in Gabarito, applied BY SELECTOR, not via `font-display`. In
  restaurant-portal UI let that selector own heading fonts rather than reaching
  for `font-display`/`font-*` overrides
- Colour tokens (reworked in the visual-hierarchy PR 1): `--primary` IS the brand
  red #FF2C32 — the same value as the `d-red` literal, so the two channels can no
  longer drift — with `--primary-hover` (= `d-red-hover` #E61C22) exposed as
  `bg-primary-hover` etc. `--destructive` is a deliberately DISTINCT darker red:
  destructive/danger UI must use it (never `bg-primary`/`bg-d-red`), and
  `--secondary` (94%) is now a lighter tier than `--muted` (88%) — don't collapse
  them back. Contrast rule: white on brand red is only ~3.7:1, so brand red may
  only sit behind LARGE/BOLD CTA text; small white-on-red text must pair with
  `--destructive` or `--primary-hover` (both ≥4.5:1 with white)
- Semantic type + radius tokens exist in `tailwind.config.js` — `text-page-title`,
  `text-section-title`, `text-card-title`, `text-body`, `text-caption`,
  `text-micro` (11px hard floor), and `rounded-card` (20px, the diner dish-card
  corner). They are px-fixed because the 14px root shrinks rem sizes ~12.5%
  (the origin of the old half-pixel `text-[18.5px]`-style hacks). Do NOT add new
  arbitrary `text-[..px]` / `rounded-[..px]` values — pick a token, or extend the
  scale deliberately

## Key Domain Concepts
- `MenuItem` has two independent boolean fields — NEVER conflate them:
  - `available`: controls whether the item appears on the menu at all
  - `in_stock`: controls whether the item can be ordered. False = "Sold out" badge
- These require separate UI controls and separate API calls
- Dietary tags live on `MenuItem.tags` (allergens were rewired onto this
  field) — `tags` is the UI source of truth for the dietary/allergen pills. The
  serializer shape still carries a legacy `allergens: string[]` field (mapped
  through by `menu.service`), but it does NOT drive any dietary-tag UI — always
  build tag pills off `tags`, never `allergens`
- Menu items carry modifier groups + add-on extras (the diner customises an item
  with these before it hits the basket):
  - `MenuItem.options` is an `ItemModifiers` OBJECT
    (`{hasModifiers, groups: ModifierGroup[]}`) on the model — it is
    JSON-stringified ONLY in the save payload, never on the model. Normalise the
    raw payload with `parseModifierGroups()` (in `_common/utils/modifier-utils.ts`:
    drops unavailable choices, coerces `single`→max 1, derives `required` from
    `minSelections > 0`) before rendering the selectors
  - Extras are themselves MenuItems flagged `is_extra = true`; an item links its
    applicable extras via `extras_applicable` (sent JSON-stringified) bounded by
    `extras_min_selections` / `extras_max_selections`, and reads them back as the
    hydrated `MenuItem.extras: MenuItemExtraRef[]`
  - The shared selectors (`app-modifier-groups-selector` / `app-extras-selector`)
    are pure — the host owns selection state + validation; `selectionConstraintPhrase()`
    (same utils file) gives both surfaces identical "Select N" / "Select up to N"
    wording. Validation is client-side on BOTH the operator item form and the
    diner item-detail; the server validates shape but does not block
- `discount_details` has a single canonical shape — do NOT introduce
  `raw_*` mirrors of its fields
- `preset_tags` is sent to the backend as a native array, never a
  JSON-stringified array
- To clear a nullable field on PATCH, send `null` directly. The
  `clear_<field>` sentinel pattern was removed; `ApiService.postPatch`
  now preserves `null` end-to-end
- Kitchen tickets (`KitchenTicket`) move through `FulfilmentStatus`:
  `new → preparing → ready → served`. Advances must be legal (no jumps);
  `recall` steps back within a recall window; `priority` is an independent
  flag. Mutations are optimistic and revert on a failed PATCH
- Error toasts & offline UX: the HTTP error interceptor surfaces failed-request
  messages as toasts via the global `ToastService` (the old `MessageService`
  persistent banner has been retired). When a component surfaces its own toast for
  that same error (e.g. a blocked delete in the Tables Setup View), call
  `this.toast.clear()` first so the user sees one clean message, not two. It also
  toasts a 429 as a warning. Network-offline (status 0) is owned per-surface
  instead of by a global toast: a `ConnectivityService` (`navigator.onLine`) drives
  the back-office `OfflineBannerComponent` and the diner `OfflineStripComponent`,
  and the interceptor suppresses its global 'no network' toast on those surfaces
  (it still fires for login/auth and for a server-down-while-online status 0)

## Mock Data Pattern
- DashboardService now splits its mock flag in two (like TablesService):
  - `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` — core dashboard metrics are still mock
  - `USE_MOCK_REVIEWS = false` — the Reviews card is real-wired to `reviews/summary/`
    (its in-memory mock stays dormant behind the flag as a design-review aid)
- TablesService now splits the flag in two:
  - `USE_MOCK_SETUP = false` — Setup View (areas, tables) is real-wired
  - `USE_MOCK_SERVICE = true` — Service View (reservations, waitlist,
    seated parties) is still mock
- KitchenOrderService uses a single `USE_MOCK_DATA = false` flag — the
  Kitchen View is real-wired; the in-memory mock dataset stays dormant behind
  the flag as a design-review aid (flip to `true` locally)
- The Settings section services in `src/app/_services/` are all real-wired
  (`USE_MOCK_DATA = false`): `restaurant-identity`, `restaurant-availability`,
  `restaurant-tax-receipts`, and `role-permissions` (the owner-only Roles & access
  grid — GET/PUT `restaurant-setup/role-permissions/` (note the `restaurant-setup/`
  prefix — the un-prefixed path 404s, fixed in f753877); GET parses via the
  defensive `parseGrid`, PUT sends `{restaurant, role, modules}`; dormant mock
  behind the flag, mirroring `restaurant-identity`). Staff
  & roles, Billing, and Account & security call `ApiService` directly (no mock flag)
- ReportsService uses a single `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` flag (mock-first),
  mirroring DashboardService — all four reports render mock data while a dormant
  `reports-adapter` parsing layer + scaffolded real endpoints wait behind the
  flag. The flag is a `static` on `ReportsService` (not a module `const`) so the
  contract specs can flip it to exercise the real branch. The slug+param and
  response-shape contracts are now PINNED by `reports.service.spec.ts` +
  `reports-adapter.spec.ts` against the backend-derived contract — but they are
  UNVERIFIED against a LIVE API (see the flip-time gate below)
- Dashboard and Reports mock data derive revenue from a SHARED per-(restaurant,day)
  basis in `src/app/_shared/mock/` (`daily-revenue.ts`, `hour-of-day.ts`, both
  spec-pinned) so the two surfaces stay numerically consistent — reuse it rather than
  re-deriving mock revenue in a new surface
- For any new module service, follow the same constant-flag pattern.
  Split flags by sub-domain when different views go live at different times
- Dashboard real endpoints: `reports/restaurant/dashboard-v2/` (core metrics, gated by
  `USE_MOCK_DATA`) and `reviews/summary/` (Reviews card, already live behind
  `USE_MOCK_REVIEWS = false`) — both parsed through `dashboard-adapter`
- Tables real endpoints: reservations, waitlist, table-actions — all exist
  in the backend already and remain to be wired for the Service View
- Kitchen real endpoints: GET `kitchen/orders/active/` (polled), PATCH
  `kitchen/orders/{id}/fulfilment-status/` and `kitchen/orders/{id}/priority/`
- Reviews real endpoints: GET `reviews/analytics/` (Overview) and `reviews/`
  (paginated Feed via `ApiService.loadAllPages`), PATCH
  `reviews/{id}/resolution/` (resolve/reopen + optional note), POST
  `reviews/submit/` (diner capture). `ReviewsService` has no mock flag — it
  calls `ApiService` directly through a `reviews-adapter` layer
- Reports real endpoints (scaffolded, dormant behind `USE_MOCK_DATA = true`):
  GET `reports/restaurant/sales-trends/` (params `category`=daily|monthly|
  quarterly|annual + `result`=table — the FE's "aggregate" is the backend's
  trends table; there is NO `sales-aggregate` slug), `…/menu-summary/` (param
  `grouping`), `…/transactions-summary/`, `…/diners-summary/`; paginated (via
  `ApiService.loadAllPages`) `…/sales-listing/`, `…/transactions-listing/`,
  `…/diners-listing/`. Backend wraps menu-summary in `data:{grouping,rows}` and
  emits sales-trends order counts as `count`, diners-summary as
  `average_spend_per_identified_diner`/`most_active_diner` — the adapter reads
  these exact keys (pinned by `reports-adapter.spec.ts`). Backend
  `transaction_type` is the `order_*` vocab (`order_payment`/`order_refund`/
  `order_charge`/`subscription`); the adapter's `txnType` strips the `order_`
  prefix to the FE `payment`/`refund`/`charge`/`subscription` tokens (else a
  refund mislabels as 'Payment')
- KNOWN GAP (follow-up, not a flip blocker): backend `payment_mode` vocab is
  `cash`/`momo`/`card`, but the FE `PaymentMode` union is
  `MTN MoMo`/`Airtel MoMo`/`Cash`. The adapter passes the raw token through and
  the "Method" column renders it as plain text, so it degrades gracefully — but
  the values don't match. A proper fix needs a product call (backend can't
  distinguish MTN vs Airtel — it stores only `momo`) plus a model + mock-data
  rework; deferred to its own change
- Only flip a mock flag to `false` when design is finalised and the
  backend endpoint is confirmed
- ReportsService flip-time gate — the four report contracts are pinned by the
  specs above but UNVERIFIED against a live API (no real restaurant with orders
  exists yet). Before flipping `ReportsService.USE_MOCK_DATA` to `false`: (1) run
  the contract specs (`npm run test:ci`) and confirm green; (2) re-verify ALL
  FOUR reports (Sales, Menu, Transactions, Diners) end-to-end against the live
  backend — slug, params AND response shape — since the mock returns
  frontend-shaped data and masks any drift until flip; (3) resolve the
  `payment_mode` vocab gap above

## Known Issues & Deferred Work
- `ngx-intl-telephone-input` was REMOVED (PRs 2a–2c) and replaced by the
  in-repo standalone `<app-dinify-phone-input>`
  (`src/app/shared/dinify-phone-input` — Uganda-only static `+256` + local
  flag). Its orphaned peer `awesome-phonenumber` was dropped with it. Do not
  reintroduce either: the stale Angular `^14` peer and the remote
  `raw.githubusercontent` flag-sprite hotlink (a CSP/licence exposure) were the
  whole reason for the swap. Consumer contract (settled after the swap): the
  component DISPLAYS the national number only (the static `+256` overlay is the
  sole country code shown, so an autofilled/pasted `+256`/`256`/trunk-`0` value
  never double-prefixes) but always EMITS the canonical `dialCode + national`
  MSISDN (plus-/space-free, e.g. `256755116061`) via BOTH `(valueChange).phoneNumber`
  and its `ControlValueAccessor` (`formControlName`) value. Consume the emitted
  value directly as the login/lookup key; never prepend `+256` or a trunk `0`
  yourself
- localStorage to httpOnly cookie migration requires backend coordination
- Login 500 regression still outstanding — parked pending Apache log access
- Tables Service View is parked AND hidden from the UI (MVP ships Setup View
  only); `TablesComponent.activeView` is forced to `'setup'`. It still sits on
  mock data (`USE_MOCK_SERVICE = true`) — real reservations/waitlist endpoints
  exist but are not yet wired. Its write methods fail loud in their non-mock
  branch (via `serviceViewNotWired`), so wire the real endpoints before flipping
  the flag. `mapApiTable` also does not yet map `raw.server_id` onto
  `RestaurantTable.serverId` (declared but unpopulated) — wire that alongside
  the Service View; the `server_id` contract may change by then

## Verification
Before raising any PR:
1. Run `npm run type-check` and confirm zero TypeScript errors
2. Run `npm run lint` and confirm clean
3. Run `npm run test:ci` for any module you touched
4. Run `npm run build:prod` and confirm zero errors
5. Confirm standalone components are in `imports`, not `declarations`

A convenience runner `scripts/verify.sh` runs all four checks in CI order
(continuing past failures so you see every problem at once, exiting non-zero if
any fail). It is a manual pre-PR gate — run it and paste the output into the PR;
it is intentionally NOT wired as a hook.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all four (`type-check`, `lint`,
`test:ci`, `build:prod`) on every PR to `main`. The production deploy workflow
(`deploy-prod.yml`) builds with `--configuration=uat` (intentionally still the
uat build config for now — the prod backend API doesn't exist yet) and pushes to
the `dinify-prod` Firebase Hosting target on every merge to `main`. A third
workflow (`audit.yml`, "Dependency Audit") runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`
weekly (Mondays 06:30 UTC) and on manual dispatch — it is NOT a PR check and
never blocks a merge; it just fires a notification if a high/critical advisory
reappears. package.json keeps a small `overrides` block (`lodash-es`, gaxios's
`uuid`, `@grpc/grpc-js`, `esbuild`) to hold the audit-zero baseline — don't
strip it; the `esbuild` pin (0.28.1) can be dropped once `@angular/build` ships
on esbuild ≥0.28.1. All three workflows
install with `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` — use the same flag locally, since a
plain `npm ci`/`npm install` can trip over peer-dependency conflicts.

Build scripts `build:prod`, `build:uat`, and `build:staging` map to the
matching angular.json configurations, all built by the esbuild
`@angular/build:application` builder. Unit tests run on Karma + Jasmine via the
`@angular/build:karma` builder (`npm run test:ci` uses ChromeHeadless).
