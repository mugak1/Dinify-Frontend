/**
 * THE RETAINED-CANDIDATE PATH — a fresh advisory query over the dependency graph a
 * certified candidate was BUILT FROM, long after the build machine is gone (D08 B2.2).
 *
 * `audit()` scans a checkout: it walks the node_modules `npm ci` just installed and
 * refuses anything else. A promotion has no such checkout. It holds a candidate, and
 * beside it the evidence certification retained: the exact package.json and lockfile,
 * and the snapshot certification took of the tree those two produced. This module is the
 * EXPLICIT path for that situation, kept apart from `audit()`/`reevaluate()` so neither of
 * their checkout bindings is relaxed to make it fit.
 *
 * WHAT IS OBSERVED AND WHAT IS NOT, stated because the difference is the whole point:
 *   - The advisory answer is a NEW query, made now, by the pinned scanner, over the
 *     retained lock graph. `npm audit` reads the LOCKFILE graph (Arborist's
 *     `loadVirtual`), so a directory holding only the two retained files is asked
 *     exactly the question certification asked — it is a scan-only replay, not a
 *     reinstall, and no package code, lifecycle script or build of the candidate runs.
 *   - WHAT WAS INSTALLED is not re-observed. It cannot be: those bytes are gone. It is
 *     the CERTIFICATION-TIME observation (installed paths and versions, and why each
 *     locked-but-absent optional package was absent), read from the retained snapshot
 *     and checked here to be exactly the retained lock graph. No node_modules is forged
 *     and nothing calls one "observed".
 *   - A digest of an installed tree is a digest of package PATHS AND VERSIONS, as npm
 *     wrote them. It is not a hash of every executable byte, and nothing here says it is.
 *
 * `collect()` is the per-graph scan used for all three graphs a promotion assesses
 * (retained application, installed scanner, installed publisher toolchain). It records
 * each scanner run's own start and finish from the injected clock, so no timestamp is
 * reused for several lifecycle facts.
 *
 * The scanner runner and the clock are parameters so the regression matrix can drive
 * every failure deterministically. There is no flag, variable or policy field that
 * substitutes another scanner, registry or threshold.

// ── the scanner's own record of what it was doing (FRONTEND-ONLY, D08 lane A) ──────
//
// WHY. Readiness run 36283185235 went red because the application scan reached the policy
// timeout, and all it left was an empty stdout, an empty stderr and a SIGTERM. npm writes
// what it was doing to a DEBUG LOG, and that log went to the runner's home directory and
// was gone with the runner. Its cause stays UNKNOWN; nothing here recovers it.
//
// WHAT THIS KEEPS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT SAY. Each scan is given its own fresh, absolute log
// directory (`--logs-dir`, one npm config key: the scanner, its version, registry, audit
// flags, timeout, retries and cache are untouched), outside everything scanned or
// uploaded. After the scan — whatever its outcome — at most ONE regular log file from
// that directory is read, from its END, within a fixed window, and re-rendered as a small
// allowlisted projection of npm's own events (requests started, responses completed,
// retries, audit errors, exit code). Every retained field is re-validated and re-written,
// never copied: URLs lose credentials and queries, anything not on the allowlist —
// configuration, argv, paths, environment, stack traces — is counted and dropped. It is a
// SANITIZED PROJECTION, not a complete raw log, and the file says so in its first line.
//
// These are the LAST OBSERVED npm EVENTS, nothing more. npm writes a request's line when
// its response body ENDS (npm-registry-fetch's check-response.js; for an error status, when
// the status arrives), several requests can be outstanding at once, and a process can
// be waiting on something no line mentions — so the last line is never evidence of which
// request stalled, and no reader here names one.
//
// A diagnostic is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY: whether it could be kept never changes a scan's
// classification, and a failure to keep it never replaces the scan's own result.
//
// Admin carries an earlier, separately deployed copy of this module without this section:
// the extension is deliberate and frontend-only (release/README.md, "Scanner diagnostics").
